In order to run this you'll have to download all the files included in the folder because the main.py file reaches into each and every other file in order to function. Make sure they are all in the same folder. Open the main.py file in pycharm or vs code and click run. If there are errors the file system must be set up incorrectly. Make sure they are all together in the same folder before you try and run the main.py file. Don't try and run any other file on it's own because it probably wont work.
